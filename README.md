# RTL Design Basics in Verilog

This repository showcases a wide range of foundational RTL design modules implemented in Verilog HDL. These are essential for building complex digital systems and demonstrate strong fundamentals in logic design and simulation.

## 📁 Key Modules Included
  
### 🧠 Arithmetic & Logic Units
- Ripple Carry Adder
- Carry Lookahead Adder
- Carry Skip Adder
- Zero/One Detectors
- Barrel Shifter

### 🏗️ Memory Elements
- Single/Multi Access Registers
- SRAM & Dual Port RAM
- FIFO using `push/pop` and `rd/wr` control
- 2D Memory, 4-way Set-Associative Cache

### 🔄 Sequential Logic
- D Flip-Flop (inside other modules)
- Johnson Counter using FSM
- Sequence Detector (FSM-based)
- LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register)
- IO Register

### ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Languages**: Verilog HDL
- **Simulation Tools**: Vivado / ModelSim

## 🔍 Highlights
- Clean modular coding style
- Focused on core logic design principles
- Tested through simulation waveforms

This project reflects my journey in mastering the RTL design flow, from basic arithmetic units to advanced memory control using FSMs.
